Prediction with Regression

Project Overview:
This repository contains two regression projects using simple linear regression:

Delivery Time Prediction

Objective: Predict the delivery time based on sorting time.

Dataset: delivery_time.csv

Approach: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), transformations, and selected the best model.


Salary Hike Prediction

Objective: Build a prediction model for salary hike based on experience.

Dataset: salary_hike.csv

Approach: Analyzed data, performed feature engineering, and built a regression model.
