# Advanve Project 1 & 2
# Prediction with Regression

## Project Overview

This repository contains two regression projects using **Simple Linear Regression**:

1. **Delivery Time Prediction**
2. **Salary Hike Prediction**


## 1. Delivery Time Prediction

### **Objective:**
To predict the delivery time based on sorting time.

### **Dataset:**
`delivery_time.csv`

### **Approach:**
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the relationship between sorting time and delivery time.
- Applied necessary **transformations** (e.g., log transformation) to improve model accuracy.
- Built and evaluated a **Simple Linear Regression model** to predict delivery time.

## 2. Salary Hike Prediction

### **Objective:**
To build a prediction model for salary hike based on years of experience.

### **Dataset:**
`salary_hike.csv`

### **Approach:**
- Analyzed the dataset to identify the relationship between **experience** and **salary hike**.
- Performed **feature engineering** to enhance the model.
- Built a **Simple Linear Regression model** and evaluated its performance.
